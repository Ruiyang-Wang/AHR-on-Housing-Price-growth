## ðŸ“„ Overview

This repository contains the code, data references, and findings from the research paper that investigates how **short-term rental (STR) platforms like Airbnb impact long-term housing prices and price volatility in New York City**.

The study employs a combination of **OLS regression** and **machine learning models** to quantify the effect of STR density (measured in listings per square kilometer) on housing market trends. It finds that STR density is a consistent and statistically significant predictor of rising housing prices, especially in boroughs like Manhattan and Brooklyn.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- A one-unit increase in STR density is associated with an estimated **$4,784** increase in housing price.
- Each additional **bathroom** contributes ~$308,124 to housing price; each **bedroom** adds ~$26,605.
- STR density is also statistically associated with **housing price volatility**, though the economic impact is modest.
- **Random Forest** and **regression tree** models confirm STR density as the most important feature in predicting prices.


## ðŸ“¦ Datasets Used

- **New York City Airbnb Open Data (2019)** â€“ [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)
- **USA Real Estate Dataset** â€“ [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset)
- Additional macroeconomic and policy context sourced from FRED and peer-reviewed literature.

## ðŸ§  Methods

- **OLS Regression** with fixed effects for boroughs
- **Feature engineering** for STR density and housing price volatility
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forests and Regression Trees for non-linear effects and interaction detection
